## How to find data required

* Answer the first question of the quiz while opening network tab on inspect  
* Find `continue.php`, go down to form data, and you will find lesson id, pageid, sesskey, and answerid  
* Keep answering the questions and record the correct answer ids and if it is a t/f question  
* Go to application tab and find the moodle session id cookie  
__The moodle session cookie name may vary across different moodle courses, in my case it is MoodleSessionipe1__
